      <h3>PASSION</h3>
    <p>I am incredibly passionate about technology. I am a maximizer and I make sure I bring excellence to everything I do. I am very creative and analytical. I embrace challenge as I love critical thinking and problem solving. My motivation to excel is due to my burning desire to keep learning.</p>
    <p>Other than technology, I love photography and painting. I love travelling. I really like watching action films. I've always enjoyed watching people play sports, specifically basketball. I would say I am more masculine when it comes to psychological traits. I like playing with flying drones and other remotely controlled devices. I get fascinated and curious by the subtle things in life. I love silhouettes and sunsets. </p>

      <h3>PATH</h3>
    <p>I was born in Quezon City, Philippines on the 9th of April, 1993. After a mere year and a half of existence, my family migrated to London, UK. I spent my childhood years inside England's borders, where I learned how to ride a bike and how tea is not just for the Queen(though she makes it look very fancy). At the age of 8, we flew back to the Philippines for two years and then set off again to another foreign land. Malaysia became my home during my high school years. Time flew by and my college years were spent in Manila, Philippines. Here is where I took up my bachelor's degree in Communication. Though it was fun and dynamic, I just couldn't find the fulfillment I hoped for.</p>
    <p>My tech story began here in the United States of America. I landed on American soil on July 18, 2014. I had no idea what to expect, but I knew what I wanted to do. Learn. Learn technology.

      <h3>PURPOSE</h3>
    <p>
    I come from a country that is not as developed as first-world countries. It is where children are still seen on the streets begging for food or money, where people without homes cannot fend for themselves, and where resources are undeniably deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
    I always thought the famous quote "Be the change you want to see" was too cliche. In my mind, I was too small and insignificant to create any slight impact on anything. I grew up oblivious to my surroundings. As long as I was comfortable with what I had, I paid no attention to my environment. That completely turned around when I experienced living in my own country, grown up and aware of its circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>"Earn as much as you can, so you can give as much as you can." This is my life motto. Everything I do, the actions and words I choose, I do it for my one true purpose.</p>
